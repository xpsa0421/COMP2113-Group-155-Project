A Chip on your Shoulder
A Dime a dozeN
A fool & his money are soon parted
A Dime a dozeN
An arm & a leg
Back to square ONE
barking uP the Wrong Tree
beating Around the BUSH
Between a ROCK & a hard place
Burst your Bubble
Close but NO Cigar
cry over spilled milk
cut to the chase
Cup of Joe
curiosity Killed the CAT
A fool & HIS Money are SOon parTeD
Burst your bubble
Carpe Diem
Beating AROUND the BUsh
A blessing in DisgUiSE
Better Late the Never
bITe the Bullet
BreaK A LEG
GO BACK to the Drawing BoArd
So FAr SO Good
